Introduction
============

Top Level View is a hierarchy based status view for Icinga Web 2.

You can define a hierarchical structure containing hosts, services and host groups.
This view presents you an overview of the overall status of the sub-hierarchies.

These hierarchical structures are configured in a YAML file. Example:

```yaml
name: My View
children:
- name: Section 1
  children:
  - name: Tile 1
    children:
    - host: localhost
    - host: localhost
      service: disk
    - host: anotherhost
      service: ssh
  - name: Tile 2
    hostgroup: linux-servers
  - name: Tile 3
```

**Hint:** Top Level View can use additional status logic for its views, see later chapters on details.

## Installation

Top Level View is a module for Icinga Web 2, and can be installed via git or a tarball.

The only other requirement is the PHP YAML extension.

**Hint**: Make sure to reload your web server after installing the extension.

    # on RHEL and compatible
    dnf install php-pecl-yaml
    systemctl reload httpd.service

    # on Debian / Ubuntu
    apt-get install php-yaml
    systemctl reload apache2.service

You can download the latest released tarball from [GitHub](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-toplevelview/releases).

    tar xf icingaweb2-module-toplevelview-1.0.0.tar.gz
    mv icingaweb2-module-toplevelview-1.0.0/ /usr/share/icingaweb2/modules/toplevelview

Or - if you prefer - use Git.

    git clone https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-toplevelview.git \
